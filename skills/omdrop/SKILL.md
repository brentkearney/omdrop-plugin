# Omdrop: AirDrop from Omarchy

Omdrop is the `omdrop` command, installed by the Omdrop shell plugin. It speaks
AirDrop to nearby Apple devices over the Mac's own Wi-Fi radio. Run
`omdrop help` for every command; this file covers what an agent needs.

## Sending

```bash
omdrop send NAME FILE...        # files, as one transfer accepted once
omdrop send NAME URL...         # web links: they open in NAME's browser
```

- **NAME** is the device's name as its owner sees it (`MyMac`, `Alex's iPhone`),
  matched case-insensitively. An exact match wins over a longer name that
  contains it. If the user gave a name, pass it as given.
- **`send` turns Omdrop on when it's off**, for its usual window (10
  minutes), then keeps asking nearby devices for their names for up to two
  minutes, printing each device it hears. Let it run: a device can take a
  minute or more to be heard. A send without a NAME needs Omdrop on first.
- **Send a web page as its URL**, never as a file. `omdrop send MyMac
  https://example.com/` opens the page in a browser tab on a Mac. A `.webloc`
  or `.url` file holding a web link is sent as that link automatically.
  Do not write a `.webloc` or `.html` file to send a link: a Mac saves a file
  to Downloads instead of opening it.
- Links and files go in separate sends. Folders can't be sent; compress one
  first.
- An iPhone listens only in bursts. `send` keeps trying for 30 seconds
  (`--wait SECONDS` for longer). If it still fails, ask the user to open a
  share sheet on the phone, then retry.
- Exit status 0 means the device accepted it. A device on the same Apple ID
  usually accepts without a prompt; otherwise its owner sees one, so tell the
  user to accept on that device.

### When a send fails

| Output | What to do |
|---|---|
| `No device called "X" answered` | Show the user the names that did answer. Ask them to open AirDrop (Finder's AirDrop window, or a share sheet) on X, then retry. |
| `Name lookup did not finish` | Nothing was sent. Ask the user to open AirDrop on the device, then retry. |
| `Several devices match` | Show the user the listed devices. Retry with the `omdrop send --to ADDRESS …` line they choose. |
| `Peers must be in "Everyone" mode` | This computer is using a self-signed identity. Ask the user to set AirDrop on the recipient to Everyone for 10 Minutes. |
| `They declined it.` | The recipient refused. Do not resend unless the user asks. |
| `needs a newer Wi-Fi driver package` | Tell the user to run `omdrop install-driver` in a terminal. It needs their password. |
| `needs a newer radio backend` | Tell the user to update the package the message names. `omdrop install-driver` cannot update it. |
| `could not read the peer table` | Show the user the whole message: it carries the radio helper's own reason. If it says the session has no seat, the user can run the command from their desktop session instead. |

## Receiving and status

```bash
omdrop status                   # on or off, time left, the name others see
omdrop on 10m                   # receive for 10 minutes ("forever", "once")
omdrop off                      # stop; refuses while a send is running
omdrop peers -n                 # nearby devices, with names
omdrop dir                      # where received files land (~/Downloads)
```

Turning Omdrop on makes this computer visible to nearby devices. Do that only
when the user asks to receive, or as part of a send they asked for. Received
links arrive as `.url` files in the download folder; Omdrop never opens them
by itself.

## Don'ts

- Don't run `omdrop` with `sudo`, and don't edit files under
  `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/netmojo.omdrop/`.
- Don't change `omdrop visibility`, `omdrop name`, `omdrop identity`, or the
  known senders unless the user asks for that specifically.
